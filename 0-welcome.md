# Python Data Structures Tutorial
## Introduction
<insert picture here>
Welcome to an intro level tutorial to data structures within python! In this tutorial, we are going to cover three different data structures:

* [Queues](./1-Queues.md)
* [Sets](./2-Sets.md)
* and [Trees](./3-Trees.md)

Each chapter will have its own examples and practice problems so you can work with them a bit yourself and hopefully understand better how to use these powerful tools!
